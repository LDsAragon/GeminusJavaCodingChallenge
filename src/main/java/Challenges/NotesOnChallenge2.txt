This code finds the minimum unique value from an array of integers. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

It defines several constants and arrays:

FIRST_ELEMENT is a constant set to 0, representing the index of the first element in a list.
MAX_APPEARANCES is a constant set to 1, representing the maximum number of appearances allowed for a value to be considered unique.
NEW_LINE is a constant string set to "\n", representing a new line character.
array is an array of Integer objects containing a list of numbers.
array1 and array2 are additional arrays that are not used in the provided code.
The main method is executed when the program is run:

It starts by recording the current system time using System.nanoTime().
The array is converted to a list of Integer objects using Arrays.asList(array).
The list is then processed to filter out values that appear exactly MAX_APPEARANCES times in the list. This is done using a stream and the filter operation with a lambda expression.
The resulting unique values are then made distinct, sorted, and collected back into a list using the distinct, sorted, and collect operations.
The original list of values, the list of unique values, and the minimum value from the unique list are printed to the console.
The end time is recorded using System.nanoTime() again, and the duration of the process is calculated in milliseconds and seconds.
The duration is printed to the console.
In summary, the code finds the unique values from the array and prints the minimum value among them, along with some additional information such as the original list of values and the duration of the process.
